SmartPay Gateway — A Lightweight, Production-Ready Payment Gateway (FastAPI + MySQL)

SmartPay Gateway is a high-performance, developer-friendly payment gateway system built using FastAPI, MySQL, Jinja2, and SQLAlchemy.
It demonstrates how real payment systems like PhonePe, Razorpay, and Stripe work internally — covering merchant onboarding, secure checkout pages, order creation, and payment confirmation flows.

This project is designed with industry-level architecture, clean code, and scalable components, making it perfect for production simulation, interviews, and showcasing backend engineering skills.
